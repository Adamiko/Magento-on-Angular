Mao
=========

Tired of Magento's lack of unit testing? Configuration over convention? Use of Prototype.js? Badly written JavaScript? Untested third-party modules? Likewise! Mao brings Magento into the 21st century.

Unit Testing
---------

All unit tests for both JavaScript and PHP can be run from the terminal: `grunt test`.

 * Run PHPUnit tests only: `grunt php-test`
 * Run Jasmine tests only: `grunt js-test`
 * PHP specific unit tests are available with the `phpunit` command from the `/api/` directory;
 * JavaScript specific unit tests are available via the URL `/store/tests/`;

Laravel API
---------

If you prefer to use another JS framework such as Ember or Meteor, then you're more than welcome to use the API in isolation. Below we've documented the URLs and their purposes:

 * `/products` &ndash; fetch all the products;
 * `/product/5` &ndash; fetch a product with the ID of 5;
 * `/categories` &ndash; fetch all the categories and their sub-categories;
